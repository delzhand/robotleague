In 21XX, after the Climate Wars had been resolved, the remaining powers of Sol-3 signed a pact to ensure the future of the human race. A new era of technological wonder began. With the completion of the Orbital Solar Capacitor Array or OSCA, mankind was able to focus on restoring the natural beauty of the planet.

In service of this end, rapid advancement were made in the fields of robotics. During this time of rapid innovation, many early models and prototypes were consigned to hangars and warehouses. However, many operators of such machines found a certain beauty in those original designs.

These "vintage" machines were the first participants in Robot League Blastball.

The sport quickly grew in popularity, and what at first seemed like a cottage industry of tinkers, pilots, and statisticians became a worldwide phenomenon.

Attracting many of humanity's best and brightest minds, the league robots began to outpace their industrial forbears. Soon they had produced a new generation of robots. Larger, faster, stronger, and capable of taking the sport to new frontiers.

As humanity expanded to the other planets in the solar system, so too did Blastball.

And then, in 22XX, the radio broadcasts of the sport reached The Beacon, a quantum accelerator that propagated the signal to the other sentient races of the universe. The signal told them we'd moved beyond internecine conflict. And thus, humanity was finally welcomed into a greater family - a family that had been waiting for us for a long time.

Within decades, the sport no longer was limited to humanity's home solar system, or even to humanity itself. Dozens of species and beings joined the league, some piloting mechanical, biological, or even psychic constructs, some participating directly.

And so in the spirit of universal comeraderie, the sport took on a new name, the name that it holds to this day.
